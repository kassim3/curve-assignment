This script will ingest the file from the data folder and insert the valid rows into the database

## How to run

1.  Copy the `.env.example` file save it as `.env`
2.  Change the value of the `MONGO_URL` to match your Mongo credentials
3.  Then run the script `npm start`

## Things I would have liked to implement if I had more time

- Allow the ability to process multiple files by adding them to the data folder
- Add docker/docker-compose file
